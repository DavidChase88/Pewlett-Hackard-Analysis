# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of the analysis is to help Bobby's manager determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Results:

- As we can see from the summary table of possible retirees by title, there are 29,414 Senior Engineers that could retire. 
- From this same table we only see 2 Managers that could retire. This seems a little off and would want to investigate the data a bit more.
- There is only 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program with the criteria of being born in 1965.
- There are 64,398 roles potentially retiring and the company only identified 1,549 employees the company identified to replace them. So the company can use this opportunity to streamline the company without having to deal with the hit to morale mass firings might entail.

## Summary: 

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

We just need to look at the Retiring Titles Table and add the title counts of everyone that could be retiring. This total shows 64,398 roles that potentially need to be filled. Though I would still want to look at the Manager data as having only 2 Managers possibly retire seem very low.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There is actually an abundance of potential retiring employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard. The problem will be that the company needs to create a program quickly to train or hire the potentially 63,000 replacement employees or in the next few years. They should do a two part analysis, looking what steps and programs would need to be taken in order to train there replacements as well as use this opportunity to see if they can become more efficient and streamline its labor force in the coming years to improve profit margins. 

### Two additional Queries:

1. I would want to do more digging into the Manager numbers.
2. I would want to expand the potential mentorship pool beyond 1965 birthdays and instead look at years at positions or additional data on job performances.
